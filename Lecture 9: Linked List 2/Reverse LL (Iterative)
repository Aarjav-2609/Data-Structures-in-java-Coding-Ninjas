Problem statement
Given a singly linked list of integers, reverse it iteratively and return the head to the modified list.

 Note :
No need to print the list, it has already been taken care. Only return the new head to the list.

public class Solution {

    public static Node<Integer> reverse_I(Node<Integer> head) {
        Node<Integer> prev = null;
        Node<Integer> current = head;
        Node<Integer> next = null;

        while (current != null) {
            next = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = next;
        }

        return prev; // New head after reversal
    }
}
