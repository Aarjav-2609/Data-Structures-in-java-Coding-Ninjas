Problem statement
You have been given a singly linked list of integers. Write a function that returns the index/position of integer data denoted by 'N' (if it exists). Return -1 otherwise.

Note :
Assume that the Indexing for the singly linked list always starts from 0.



public class Solution {
    public static int findNode(Node<Integer> head, int n) {
        int index = 0;
        Node<Integer> current = head;

        while (current != null) {
            if (current.data == n) {
                return index; // Found the node, return its index
            }
            current = current.next;
            index++;
        }

        return -1; // Node with data 'n' not found
    }
}
