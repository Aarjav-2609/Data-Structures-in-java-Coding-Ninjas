Problem statement
For a given a singly linked list of integers and a position 'i', print the node data at the 'i-th' position.

 Note :
Assume that the Indexing for the singly linked list always starts from 0.

If the given position 'i',  is greater than the length of the given singly linked list, then don't print anything.



public class Solution {

    public static void printIthNode(Node<Integer> head, int i) {
        int count = 0;
        Node<Integer> current = head;

        while (current != null) {
            if (count == i) {
                System.out.println(current.data);
                return;
            }
            current = current.next;
            count++;
        }
    }
}
