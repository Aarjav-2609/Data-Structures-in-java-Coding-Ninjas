Problem statement
You have been given a singly linked list of integers. Write a function to print the list in a reverse order.

To explain it further, you need to start printing the data from the tail and move towards the head of the list, printing the head data at the end.

Note :
You canâ€™t change any of the pointers in the linked list, just print the linked list in the reverse order.


public class Solution {

	public static void printReverse(Node<Integer> root) {
		if (root == null) {
            return;
        }

        // Recursively print the rest of the list in reverse order
        printReverse(root.next);

        // Print the current node's data
        System.out.print(root.data + " ");
	}
}
