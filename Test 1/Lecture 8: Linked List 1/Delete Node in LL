Problem statement
You have been given a linked list of integers. Your task is to write a function that deletes a node from a given position, 'POS'.

Note :
Assume that the Indexing for the linked list always starts from 0.

If the position is greater than or equal to the length of the linked list, you should return the same linked list without any change.



public class Solution {
    public static Node<Integer> deleteNode(Node<Integer> head, int pos) {
        if (head == null || pos < 0) {
            return head;
        }

        if (pos == 0) {
            // Delete the head node
            return head.next;
        }

        Node<Integer> current = head;
        int count = 0;

        while (count < pos - 1 && current != null) {
            current = current.next;
            count++;
        }

        if (current == null || current.next == null) {
            // Position is greater than or equal to the length of the linked list
            return head;
        }

        // Delete the node at the specified position
        current.next = current.next.next;

        return head;
    }
}
