Problem statement
Given two integers M & N, calculate and return their multiplication using recursion. You can only use subtraction and addition for your calculation. No other operators are allowed.

public class solution 
{
    public static int multiplyTwoIntegers(int m, int n)
    {
        if(n==0)
            return 0;
        return m+multiplyTwoIntegers(m,n-1);

    }
}
