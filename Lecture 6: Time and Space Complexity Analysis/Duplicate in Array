Problem statement
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N which contains numbers from 0 to (N - 2). Each number is present at least once. That is, if N = 5, the array/list constitutes values ranging from 0 to 3, and among these, there is a single integer value that is present twice. You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.

Note :
Duplicate number is always present in the given array/list.

from sys import stdin

def findDuplicate(arr, n):
    for num in arr:
        if arr[abs(num)] < 0:
            return abs(num)
        else:
            arr[abs(num)] *= -1

# Taking input using fast I/O method
def takeInput():
    n = int(stdin.readline().rstrip())

    if n == 0:
        return list(), 0

    arr = list(map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split(" ")))
    return arr, n

# Main
t = int(stdin.readline().rstrip())

while t > 0:
    arr, n = takeInput()
    result = findDuplicate(arr, n)
    print(result if result is not None else 0)
    t -= 1
