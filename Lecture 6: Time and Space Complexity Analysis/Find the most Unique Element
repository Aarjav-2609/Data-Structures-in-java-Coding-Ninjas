You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N. Where N is equal to [2M + 1].

Now, in the given array/list, 'M' numbers are present twice and one number is present only once.

You need to find and return that number which is unique in the array/list.

 Note:
Unique element is always present in the array/list according to the given condition.


public class Solution {
    public static int findUnique(int[] arr) {
        int result = 0;

        for (int num : arr) {
            result ^= num;
        }

        return result;
